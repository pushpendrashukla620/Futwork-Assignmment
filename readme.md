This is an api which parses a csv file by unique moble numbers. I have used Property of Set(set has only unique elements) in this api. It can also be done with the help of filter function.

To run this api go to api.js-> in console type-> npm install(to install all the dependencies) then type ->node api.js
and server starts running
